Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to a computational problem that incrementally builds candidates for solutions and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution. It is often used in combinatorial problems where the goal is to find a solution that satisfies certain constraints.

In Go, backtracking can be implemented using recursion. Each recursive call explores a potential solution by making a choice, and if the choice leads to a valid solution, the algorithm proceeds; otherwise, it backtracks to the previous state and explores a different choice.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func combine(n, k int) [][]int {
	result := [][]int{}
	current := []int{}

	backtrack(&result, current, 1, n, k)

	return result
}

func backtrack(result *[][]int, current []int, start, n, k int) {
	if len(current) == k {
		// Found a valid combination
		combination := make([]int, k)
		copy(combination, current)
		*result = append(*result, combination)
		return
	}

	for i := start; i <= n; i++ {
		// Make a choice: Include the current element in the combination
		current = append(current, i)
		// Explore further
		backtrack(result, current, i+1, n, k)
		// Backtrack: Remove the last element to explore other choices
		current = current[:len(current)-1]
	}
}

func main() {
	n := 4
	k := 2
	result := combine(n, k)

	fmt.Println("All combinations of", k, "elements from", n, "elements:")
	fmt.Println(result)
}
```

In this example:

- The `combine` function initializes an empty result and an empty current combination, and then initiates the backtracking process.
- The `backtrack` function is the recursive backtracking function. It explores possible combinations by making choices (including elements in the current combination) and backtracking when needed (removing the last element to explore other choices).
- The `main` function calls `combine` with values `n = 4` and `k = 2` and prints all possible combinations.

When you run this program, it will output:
```
All combinations of 2 elements from 4 elements:
[[1 2] [1 3] [1 4] [2 3] [2 4] [3 4]]

```
