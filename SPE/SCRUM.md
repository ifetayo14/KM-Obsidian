VUCA
_Volatility_ is the quality of being subject to frequent, rapid and significant change. Small triggers may result in large changes. In a volatile market, for example, the prices of commodities can rise or fall considerably in a short period of time, and the direction of a trend may reverse suddenly.

_Uncertainty_ occurs when events and outcomes are unpredictable. The cause and effect are not well understood, and previous experience may not apply to the situation. It is unclear which direction events will go; in an uncertain market, for example, it is not clear if the price will go up or down or by how much.

_Complexity_ involves a multiplicity of issues and factors, some of which may be intricately interconnected. The relationships between items and people are difficult to understand. A change in one place may cause unintended changes to other things down the line. Cause and effect are obscured by many layers, and it is not clear which factors are important in the decision-making process. In a complex market, for example, the changes in gas prices affect the prices of many other items that are not directly related.

_Ambiguity_ is shaped by a lack of clarity and difficulty understanding exactly what the situation is. [Information](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/information) may be misread or misinterpreted. During ambiguous situations, all the facts are not clear. The goal or intended outcome may not be evident to all parties involved. In an ambiguous market, for example, not all information is public and unseen factors may be affecting prices.
